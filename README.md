- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BradKabosky! I'm a Web Developer from Pennsylvania in the United States. And I'm looking forward to getting more familiar with GitHub, and being able to contribute to projects along with publishing my own!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new techniques for coding in the languages I have learned. And I'm looking into expanding my knowledge on new coding languages and featues.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more with C#, JavaScript, jQuery, and T-SQL.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at kaboskyb@yahoo.com
